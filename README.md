What Is a Pregnancy Due Date Calculator?

A Pregnancy Due Date Calculator is a simple tool that helps you estimate the approximate date when your baby is expected to be born. Most calculators use:

The first day of your last menstrual period (LMP)

Or the date of conception (if known)


Using this information, the calculator projects a 40-week pregnancy timeline, which is considered full-term.

Why Is Knowing Your Due Date Important?

Knowing your due date is not just about curiosity. It’s crucial for:

1. Tracking pregnancy milestones – so you know what to expect week by week.


2. Planning prenatal care – scheduling check-ups, ultrasounds, and blood tests.


3. Monitoring fetal growth – ensuring your baby is developing healthily.


4. Preparing emotionally and physically – making lifestyle changes and planning maternity leave.

How Do Doctors Calculate the Due Date?

Doctors typically use Naëgele’s Rule, which works like this:

1. Take the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP).


2. Add one year.


3. Subtract three months.


4. Add seven days.



For example:

If your LMP was January 1, 2025, your estimated due date would be October 8, 2025.
